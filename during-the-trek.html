                <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                    <p class="sub-body">Tipping is not obligatory but in Asia tipping is a tradition, it is left to your appreciation. The tip is part of the culture of the country, it is very popular with Nepalese porters and guides. A porter who works for an agency earns according to treks and periods between 8 euros and 15 euros per day.<br>It is usual to leave by trekker between 5 and 10% of the tariff of your trek which you will distribute between the carriers, cooks and sherpas.<br>For example for a 20-day trek:</p>
                    <ul class="sub-body">
                        <li>Sirdar (your guide) 80 to 120 Euros</li>
                        <li> by Sherpa and Cook 70 to 90 Euros</li>
                        <li>by kitchen helpers, porters, yak shepherd 35 to 50 Euros</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="sub-body">These are the tips offered by the group (not per participant).<br>We advise you to personally hand in the porters, cooks and guide the tip, for example the penultimate day of trek during the evening meal together taking a "pot".<br> 
                    The porters or the cook and his help do not necessarily come with you on Kathmandu.<br>
                    Indeed, they return with the equipment by bus and you can be on plane. In addition, some porters live in the area and do not return to Kathmandu, all to say that it is better to tip during the trek on the last day or better the day before and not in Kathmandu. <br></p>

                    <p class="sub-body">An agreement between the Nepalese trekking agencies and the government limits the load of porters to 30 kg. But it is not uncommon for porters to ask for more to be better paid.<br><br>On the other hand, when porters work for Nepalese companies (lodges, construction, etc.) there is no limit load and it is not rare to meet carriers with loads of 70 to 110 kg (see movie on the Nepal crossing where a carrier tells us he is carrying 104 kg.). You will certainly meet porters who supply the lodges with coke, beer, etc. It is easy to calculate the weight of their load to the number of bottles and you will be surprised to find that they carry more than 100 kg.<br><br>Our position is that the government imposes on agencies a maximum load of 25 kg and also limits the load when it comes to work for locals.<br><br>All our porters as well as Sirdars and Sherpas are insured.<br><br>The company TSL, the world leader in the manufacture of snowshoes and manufacturer of outdoor equipment (poles, shoes, backpacks, frontal, thermos, etc.) helps us by providing shoes to our wearers.<br>The ski schools of Courchevel and Méribel provide us with instructors of previous years that allow us to equip our carriers.<br>
                    The contribution of each member of the group (if he agrees) will be to take in his luggage from France 1 or 2 monitors outfits total weight 3kg to 5 kg which will be given to the carriers.</p>

                        <li>On these treks in some important villages you will have wifi internet access</li>
                        <li>Always on these routes you will also have access over a large part of the way to the mobile phone network. At Kathmandu you can buy prepaid cards from Nepalese operators to take the Nepalese operator "Namaste".</li>
                        <li>On the more isolated treks like the Makalu base camp, the Kangchenjunga, the Dolpo, the Upper Dolpo, the Dhaulagiri Tower, there is no separate electric network in a few villages but many lodges are equipped. in solar panels. This allows you to charge small mobile devices (MP3, mobile, etc.) or even cameras. However you must plan several steps without the possibility of recharging your devices.</li>

Under the tent cooks bring you a hot tea with a big smile accompanied by a "morning" and a bowl of hot water for the toilet. Then it is the breakfast between 7am and 7.30am and the departure around 8.30am.<br><br>
                    The march is always slow it is punctuated on the speed of the carriers. We often stop and around 11:30 lunch.<br><br>
                    In the afternoon we arrive at the stage quite early at about 3 pm, which leaves time to wash, visit, rest, etc. Then it's "the time" at 4 pm tea, coffee, biscuits, etc.<br><br>
                    The evening meal is taken around 6:30 - 7:00. It is early night in Nepal.</p>
